# Renew v1.4 Update Notes
## Improvements
- Improved configuration file processing and variable handling, bringing compatibility with swiftDialog 3.0+
- Renew now has the concept of "Tokens" that can be used to swap out real-time information into your messaging
    - If you include the string `{uptime}` in any supported preference key, it will be replaced with the current uptime value in days
    - Example, consider a computer that has an uptime of 22 days: a `NormalMessage` value of `Your computer has not restarted in {uptime} days` will by dynamically replaced with `Your computer has not restarted in 22 days`
    - Supported Tokens:
        - `{uptime}`
        - `{deferralcount}`
        - `{deferralsremaining}`
    - These tokens will be swapped for any prefernece key that displays messaging, including titles, messages, and buttons for all run types.
